This project contains multiple scripts for various functions to be performed:

Part of the script is to plot and find average slope of points along a path. We enter this mode by pressing Z or z:

1. Enter 'z' or 'Z' to enter slope avg mode
2. You can now see instructions in map as well. 
   Select any two points and use the slider to provide the number of points required
3. You will be asked how many pt you will want to contribute to the average 
   slope, and you can specify an number less than the number of available pt, or select all 
4. CSV file will be created with the slope values
5.
